# Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts & Crosses)

### GitHub Live Page: https://tsv-stacks.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/

A two-player version of Tic Tac Toe that can be played from a single instance (by 'hot-seating'). Built using HTML, CSS & Vanilla JS.

This project was coded completely from scratch by myself and was so I could take my learnings of ES6 JavaScript and apply them to a project. The aim of this project was also to have as little as global code as possible.
